# Employee Database: Data Modeling, Engineering, and Analysis

The **Employee Database** project focuses on understanding employee data through effective data modeling, engineering, and analysis. The project includes creating a relational database using CSV files, designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and executing SQL queries to analyze data.

## **Project Overview**

The project is divided into three phases:

1. **Data Modeling**: An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is used to plan table relationships and normalize data.
2. **Data Engineering**: SQL scripts are utilized to create and populate database tables, ensuring proper constraints and relationships.
3. **Data Analysis**: SQL queries are written and executed to answer questions and uncover insights about employee data.

## Key Features
- Proper organization of tables using primary and foreign keys to maintain relational integrity.
- Implementation of data normalization for optimized querying and analysis.
- Detailed SQL queries answering business questions.

## Files in This Repository
- **`table_schema.sql`**: SQL script for creating the database schema.
- **`sql_challenge_queries.sql`**: SQL queries for data analysis.
- **ER Diagram**: A visual representation of the database structure.
- **CSV Files**: Source data for populating the tables.

## Analysis Questions Addressed
Examples of questions answered by the SQL queries include:
- Details about employees, such as names, salaries, and hire dates.
- Identification of employees hired in specific years.
- Information about department managers and their corresponding departments.
- Connections between employees and their departments.
- Frequencies of employee last names.
